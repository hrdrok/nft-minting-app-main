            Hafgufa, Krake, Sciu-crak, and Kraken, it goes by many names. It has taken many forms, but all accounts of the legendary Kraken come to the same conclusion.
            It's waiting around to feast on the weak, traveling its' waters. In crypto, whales are the top of the foodchain, and here we give everyone a chance to be one themselves.
            But not all is as it seems. Something about these whales are different. They're changing...evolving...or possibly mutating. Perhaps the olde tales of the Kraken weren't fables.
            Maybe, just maybe, the era of Krakens is returning.

            The Kraken is a symbol of fear, and destruction. For us, we look at it as the largest whale in the sea. Here is your chance to own your very own Kraken! Fully computer generated, and unique.
            There are no copies, and each one will give you full access to our staking protocol. Each NFT will be stakeable to earn KRAK, the token required for the next evolution of your krakens! Not interested
            in mutating your Kraken? Then trade your earned staking rewards for other tokens on Binance Smart Chain! Just remember, we plan on bring other functionality to the KRAK token!
          </p>

            100% of the royalties generated from secondary market sales, will be fed to THE Kraken. Specifically, the EverRise BSC Kraken. The EverRise Kraken will use the BNB to
            reward the holders of the $RISE token. Royalties will be 10% of every sale. Considering the average NFT project volume on PancakeSwap, this could significantly
            increase the EverRise Krakens holdings, and the communities rewards!
